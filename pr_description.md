# Remove Frontend from Docker Configuration

## Summary
This PR removes the frontend service from Docker configuration, allowing developers to run the frontend manually with `npm run dev` while keeping backend services containerized.

## Changes Made
- **Removed frontend service** from `docker-compose.yml` (lines 4-15)
- **Deleted `Dockerfile.frontend`** as it's no longer needed
- **Kept `frontend-template/` folder** - it's a documented reusable React + TypeScript + Vite template

## Frontend-Template Folder Investigation
The `frontend-template/` folder serves as a **reusable template** for building new Swisper frontend applications. Based on the comprehensive documentation in `docs/deployment/frontend-template-guide.md`, it provides:

### Purpose & Value
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Reusable UI Components**: Button, InputField, TabBar, Header, Sidebar
- **Integration Patterns**: Pre-configured for Swisper Core backend integration
- **Development Standards**: Establishes coding patterns for future projects

### Recommendation: **KEEP**
This template should be maintained as it provides significant value for future frontend implementations and serves as a foundation for consistent development practices.

## New Development Workflow
After these changes, the development workflow becomes:

1. **Start backend services**: `docker-compose up`
2. **Start frontend separately**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Access points**:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`

## Benefits
- ✅ Faster frontend development (no Docker rebuild needed)
- ✅ Direct access to Vite's hot module replacement
- ✅ Simplified debugging and development tools
- ✅ Reduced Docker complexity
- ✅ Backend services remain containerized for consistency

## Testing
- [x] Backend services start correctly with `docker-compose up`
- [x] Frontend runs standalone with `npm run dev`
- [x] Lint checks pass for both backend and frontend
- [x] No broken dependencies or references
