# Phase 4: PII Detection and Redaction Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection and redaction system implemented in Phase 4 of Swisper Core. The system uses a multi-layered approach to ensure business-critical privacy protection while maintaining Switzerland hosting compliance.

## Multi-Layered Architecture

### Layer 1: Regex Pattern Detection
Fast, reliable detection of structured PII patterns:

```python
regex_patterns = {
    "EMAIL": r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b',
    "SWISS_PHONE": r'(\+41|0041|0)\s?[1-9]\d{1,2}\s?\d{3}\s?\d{2}\s?\d{2}',
    "IBAN": r'\bCH\d{2}\s?\d{4}\s?\d{4}\s?\d{4}\s?\d{4}\s?\d{1}\b',
    "CREDIT_CARD": r'\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b',
    "SWISS_SSN": r'\b756\.\d{4}\.\d{4}\.\d{2}\b'
}
```

**Business Use Cases:**
- Customer support conversations with contact information
- Financial discussions with payment details
- Identity verification scenarios

### Layer 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
spaCy-based detection of named entities:

```python
NER_ENTITIES = ["PERSON", "GPE", "ORG", "DATE"]

"Contact John Smith at Acme Corp" â†’ "Contact [REDACTED_PERSON] at [REDACTED_ORG]"
```

**Business Use Cases:**
- Contract negotiations with company names
- Meeting discussions with participant names
- Location-based service requests

### Layer 3: LLM Fallback (Optional)
Advanced detection for complex/fuzzy PII:

```python
redactor = PIIRedactor(use_ner=True, use_llm_fallback=False)
```

**Business Use Cases:**
- Complex identity references
- Indirect personal information
- Context-dependent sensitive data

## Business-Critical PII Scenarios

### Customer Support Conversations

**Input:**
```
Customer John Smith (john.smith@company.com) called about order #12345.
His phone number +41 44 123 45 67 is on file.
Payment was made with card ending in 1234.
```

**Output:**
```
Customer [REDACTED_PERSON] ([EMAIL_a1b2c3d4]) called about order #12345.
His phone number [SWISS_PHONE_e5f6g7h8] is on file.
Payment was made with card ending in [CREDIT_CARD_i9j0k1l2].
```

**Business Value:**
- Preserves order context and business flow
- Protects customer identity and contact information
- Maintains audit trail for support quality

### Financial Advisory Discussions

**Input:**
```
Client wants to invest 50,000 CHF in tech stocks.
IBAN CH93 0076 2011 6238 5295 7 for transfers.
Meeting scheduled with Maria Rodriguez on Friday.
```

**Output:**
```
Client wants to invest 50,000 CHF in tech stocks.
IBAN [IBAN_m3n4o5p6] for transfers.
Meeting scheduled with [REDACTED_PERSON] on Friday.
```

**Business Value:**
- Preserves investment amounts and preferences
- Protects banking information
- Maintains scheduling context

### Contract Negotiations

**Input:**
```
Acme Corp (contact: ceo@acme.com) proposes 2-year agreement.
Delivery to Zurich office by Q2 2024.
Legal review by Thompson & Associates required.
```

**Output:**
```
[REDACTED_ORG] (contact: [EMAIL_q7r8s9t0]) proposes 2-year agreement.
Delivery to [REDACTED_GPE] office by Q2 2024.
Legal review by [REDACTED_ORG] required.
```

**Business Value:**
- Preserves contract terms and timeline
- Protects company identities
- Maintains legal process context

## Integration Points

### T5 RollingSummariser Integration

```python
def summarize_messages(messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
    combined_content = " ".join(content_parts)
    
    redacted_content = pii_redactor.redact(combined_content, redaction_method="placeholder")
    
    pipeline = create_rolling_summariser_pipeline()
    result = pipeline.run(query=redacted_content)
```

**Business Impact:**
- Session summaries are PII-free
- Conversation context preserved
- Compliance with data protection regulations

### Milvus Semantic Memory Integration

```python
def add_memory(self, user_id: str, content: str, memory_type: str = "preference"):
    if not pii_redactor.is_text_safe_for_storage(content):
        content = pii_redactor.redact(content, redaction_method="hash")
        metadata["pii_detected"] = True
    
    embedding = self.embedding_model.encode([content])[0].tolist()
```

**Business Impact:**
- User preferences stored safely
- Semantic search without PII exposure
- Long-term memory compliance

## Configuration Options

### Switzerland Hosting Configuration

```python
pii_redactor = PIIRedactor(
    use_ner=True,           # Local spaCy processing
    use_llm_fallback=False  # No external API calls
)
```

### Business-Specific Customization

```python
custom_patterns = {
    "EMPLOYEE_ID": r'\bEMP\d{6}\b',
    "PROJECT_CODE": r'\bPRJ-[A-Z]{3}-\d{4}\b',
    "CUSTOMER_REF": r'\bCUST\d{8}\b'
}

pii_redactor.regex_patterns.update(custom_patterns)
```

### Confidence Thresholds

```python
is_safe = pii_redactor.is_text_safe_for_storage(
    content, 
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Detection Latency
- **Regex Layer**: <5ms for typical business content
- **NER Layer**: 20-50ms depending on text length
- **Combined Processing**: <100ms for standard conversations

### Business SLA Compliance
- **Customer Support**: <200ms response time maintained
- **Contract Processing**: <500ms for document analysis
- **Memory Storage**: <100ms for preference extraction

## Monitoring and Auditing

### PII Detection Metrics

```python
logger.info(f"PIIRedactor processed text: {len(detected_entities)} entities detected")

{
    "session_id": "sess_123",
    "pii_entities_detected": 3,
    "entity_types": ["EMAIL", "PERSON", "PHONE"],
    "processing_time_ms": 45,
    "redaction_method": "placeholder"
}
```

### Compliance Reporting

```python
{
    "user_id": "user_456",
    "pii_processing_events": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2024-06-04T14:30:00Z",
            "action": "redaction_applied",
            "entity_types": ["EMAIL", "PHONE"],
            "business_context": "customer_support"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Business Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Customer Support Integration

```python
support_content = pii_redactor.redact(conversation_text, "hash")
store_support_ticket(ticket_id, support_content)

assert "order #12345" in support_content
assert "john@example.com" not in support_content
```

### 2. Financial Advisory Compliance

```python
investment_notes = pii_redactor.redact(advisor_notes, "placeholder")

assert "50,000 CHF" in investment_notes
assert "tech stocks" in investment_notes
assert "CH93 0076" not in investment_notes
```

### 3. Contract Management

```python
contract_summary = pii_redactor.redact(negotiation_notes, "hash")

assert "2-year agreement" in contract_summary
assert "Q2 2024" in contract_summary
assert "acme.com" not in contract_summary
```

## Testing and Validation

### Business Scenario Testing

```python
def test_customer_support_scenario():
    conversation = """
    Customer John Smith called about delayed order #12345.
    Contact: john.smith@email.com, Phone: +41 44 123 45 67
    Issue: Laptop delivery to Zurich office delayed by 2 weeks.
    Resolution: Expedited shipping arranged, tracking #ABC123.
    """
    
    redacted = pii_redactor.redact(conversation, "placeholder")
    
    assert "order #12345" in redacted
    assert "delayed by 2 weeks" in redacted
    assert "tracking #ABC123" in redacted
    
    assert "John Smith" not in redacted
    assert "john.smith@email.com" not in redacted
    assert "+41 44 123 45 67" not in redacted
```

### Performance Validation

```python
def test_business_performance_requirements():
    import time
    
    business_content = generate_typical_business_conversation()
    
    start_time = time.time()
    redacted = pii_redactor.redact(business_content)
    processing_time = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
    
    assert processing_time < 200
```
