# Intent Extraction Architecture

## Overview

The intent extraction system in Swisper Core uses a contract-aware routing architecture to classify user messages and route them to appropriate handlers. This document describes the current implementation and future plans.

## Current Architecture (June 2025)

### Contract-Aware Intent Router

The intent extraction system (`orchestrator/intent_extractor.py`) implements a dynamic routing manifest that includes:

1. **Available Contracts**: Loaded from `contract_templates/` directory
2. **Available Tools**: Loaded from MCP tool registry
3. **Intent Types**: chat, rag, tool_usage, contract

### Routing Manifest Structure

```json
{
  "routing_options": [
    {
      "intent_type": "chat",
      "description": "General open-ended conversation"
    },
    {
      "intent_type": "rag",
      "description": "Ask questions about uploaded or stored documents (prefix with #rag)"
    },
    {
      "intent_type": "tool_usage",
      "description": "Use tools for analysis, comparison, or information gathering",
      "tools": ["search_products", "analyze_product_attributes", ...]
    },
    {
      "intent_type": "contract",
      "description": "Execute structured workflows with specific business logic",
      "contracts": [
        {
          "name": "purchase_item",
          "template": "purchase_item.yaml",
          "description": "Template for executing a product purchase.",
          "trigger_keywords": ["buy", "purchase", "order", "acquire", "shop for", ...]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### LLM Classification Process

1. **Routing Manifest Generation**: Dynamic discovery of available contracts and tools
2. **LLM Classification**: Dedicated system prompt with structured routing options
3. **Deterministic Selection**: LLM must select from exact contract template names provided
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Predictions below 0.6 confidence fall back to chat mode
5. **Validation**: Responses that don't match available contracts are rejected

### System Prompt Design

The LLM receives:
- Complete routing manifest with available options
- Clear classification rules for each intent type
- Confidence scoring guidelines (0.9-1.0 very clear, 0.7-0.9 good match, etc.)
- Strict JSON response format requirements

### Response Validation

- **Required Fields**: intent_type, confidence, reasoning
- **Contract Template Validation**: Must match exactly from available list
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Invalid responses trigger chat mode fallback

## Current Implementation Details

### Key Functions

- `_generate_routing_manifest()`: Creates dynamic routing options
- `extract_user_intent()`: Main classification entry point
- `_classify_intent_with_llm()`: LLM-based classification with validation
- `_create_chat_fallback()`: Fallback for low confidence or errors

### Confidence Thresholds

- **High Confidence (0.8+)**: Clear intent with strong keyword matches
- **Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8)**: Good intent match with supporting context
- **Low Confidence (<0.6)**: Falls back to chat mode

### Enhanced Logging

Intent extraction logs now include:
- User message content (not just session_id)
- Detailed reasoning from LLM
- Confidence scores and decision logic
- Fallback reasons when applicable

## Current LLM Usage

**Interim Solution**: OpenAI ChatGPT-4.0
- Used during development phase
- Provides reliable intent classification
- Handles complex reasoning and context understanding

**System Prompt Strategy**:
- Conservative confidence scoring
- Explicit routing manifest inclusion
- Deterministic template selection enforcement

## Future Architecture Plans

### Specialized Intent Classification LLM

**Target**: Dedicated, smaller, faster model for intent routing
- **Options**: Mistral, Phi, Claude Haiku, or fine-tuned model
- **Benefits**: Lower latency, cost efficiency, specialized performance
- **Training**: Fine-tune on Swisper-specific intent patterns

### Enhanced Routing Capabilities

1. **Multi-Contract Workflows**: Support for complex workflows spanning multiple contracts
2. **Context-Aware Routing**: Consider conversation history for better classification
3. **Dynamic Contract Discovery**: Automatic registration of new contract types
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare different classification approaches

### Quality Assurance

1. **Intent Detection Test Suite**: Comprehensive test cases for all intent types
2. **Analytics Layer**: Log every classification decision for analysis
3. **Confidence Calibration**: Tune confidence thresholds based on real usage
4. **Misclassification Detection**: Automatic flagging of low-confidence predictions

## Contract Registry Evolution

### Current State
- **Mock Registry**: Single contract (purchase_item.yaml)
- **Manual Configuration**: Contract metadata in YAML files
- **Static Discovery**: File-based contract loading

### Future Plans
- **Dynamic Registry**: Database-backed contract management
- **Version Control**: Contract template versioning and rollback
- **Metadata Management**: Rich contract descriptions and capabilities
- **Runtime Registration**: Hot-swappable contract deployment

## Testing Strategy

### Current Testing
- **Essential Test Coverage**: 21 critical tests for core functionality
- **Browser E2E Testing**: Real API integration testing
- **Intent Classification Tests**: Specific test cases for purchase workflows

### Future Testing
- **Intent Classification Benchmarks**: Comprehensive test suite for all intent types
- **Performance Testing**: Latency and accuracy metrics
- **Regression Testing**: Automated detection of classification degradation

## Switzerland Compliance

The intent extraction system maintains Switzerland data sovereignty requirements:
- **Local Processing**: All classification can run locally when needed
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: System works without external LLM dependencies
- **Privacy by Design**: No sensitive data sent to external services without consent

## Migration Path

### Phase 1 (Current): ChatGPT-based Classification âœ…
- Contract-aware routing manifest
- Deterministic template selection
- Confidence-based fallbacks

### Phase 2 (Next): Enhanced Validation
- Comprehensive intent test suite
- Analytics and monitoring
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3 (Future): Specialized LLM
- Dedicated intent classification model
- Fine-tuned for Swisper workflows
- Reduced latency and costs

### Phase 4 (Long-term): Advanced Routing
- Multi-contract workflows
- Context-aware classification
- Dynamic contract registry

## Key Design Principles

1. **Deterministic**: LLM must select from predefined options only
2. **Extensible**: Easy to add new contracts and intent types
3. **Robust**: Graceful fallbacks for edge cases
4. **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and reasoning
5. **Compliant**: Switzerland data sovereignty maintained
6. **Testable**: Isolated testing for each component

This architecture ensures reliable intent classification while providing a clear path for future enhancements and specialized LLM integration.
