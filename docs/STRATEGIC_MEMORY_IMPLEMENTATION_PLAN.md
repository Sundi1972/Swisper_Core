## Phase 1: Fix FSM State Persistence (PR #1) - 5 ACUs

### User Stories
1. **As a user, I want my conversation state to persist correctly so I don't get stuck in infinite loops**
   - Fix infinite loop between search â†’ refine_constraints states
   - Ensure FSM state transitions are atomic and consistent
   - Validate state integrity during save/load operations

2. **As a developer, I want unified session storage so there are no conflicts between storage mechanisms**
   - Consolidate PostgreSQL session store and enhanced session persistence
   - Remove dual session storage layer conflicts
   - Ensure single source of truth for FSM state

3. **As a system, I want reliable state reconstruction so FSM continues correctly after user interactions**
   - Fix state retrieval bug where "refine_constraints" becomes "search"
   - Ensure proper FSM context serialization/deserialization
   - Add comprehensive logging for state transitions

### Technical Implementation
- **Files to modify**: `contract_engine/contract_engine.py`, `orchestrator/postgres_session_store.py`, `contract_engine/session_persistence.py`

- **Solution**: Unify storage layers with atomic state transitions

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… Users can complete full purchase flow without infinite loops
- âœ… FSM state persists correctly between user interactions
- âœ… All existing tests pass
- âœ… State transitions are logged and traceable

   - Create RAG pipeline with Dense retrieval and BM25 ranking
   - Implement Milvus vector store for semantic long-term memory
   - Store user preferences, facts, and interaction patterns

3. **As a user, I want relevant memories injected into conversations so the AI understands my context**
   - Retrieve top K=3 relevant memories for each user prompt
   - Inject memories into system prompts automatically
   - Ensure memory relevance scoring and ranking

4. **As a developer, I want memory pipelines integrated with existing architecture so they work seamlessly**
   - Connect memory pipelines to existing orchestrator
   - Integrate with current product search and preference matching
   - Maintain compatibility with existing pipeline architecture

### Technical Implementation
- **New pipelines**: `RollingSummariser`, `SemanticMemoryRAG`
- **Vector store**: Milvus cluster for semantic memory
- **Integration**: Existing Haystack pipeline architecture
- **Models**: T5-base for summarization, sentence-transformers for embeddings

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… Automatic summarization when buffer exceeds 3k tokens
- âœ… Semantic memory storage and retrieval working
- âœ… Memory-enhanced conversations show improved context awareness
- âœ… Pipeline performance meets latency requirements (<2s)

## Phase 4: Privacy & Governance (PR #4) - 5 ACUs

### User Stories
1. **As a user, I want my personal information protected so my privacy is maintained**
   - Implement PII hashing/redaction before vector storage
   - Add per-user encryption for sensitive memory data
   - Ensure GDPR compliance for all stored memories

2. **As a user, I want control over my stored memories so I can manage my data**
   - Create `/memory/list` endpoint to view stored memories
   - Implement `/memory/delete` endpoint for selective deletion
   - Add bulk memory deletion for "right to be forgotten"

3. **As a compliance officer, I want auditable memory storage so we can demonstrate data governance**
   - Implement S3-based ArtifactStore for complete audit trails
   - Store raw chat logs, FSM transitions, and contract artifacts
   - Add retention policies and automated compliance reporting

4. **As a system administrator, I want memory access controls so data is properly secured**

   - Create admin interfaces for memory management

### Technical Implementation
- **Security**: pgcrypto for encryption, PII detection/redaction

- **APIs**: RESTful memory management endpoints
- **Compliance**: GDPR-compliant data handling workflows

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… PII automatically detected and redacted/hashed
- âœ… Users can view and delete their memories
- âœ… Complete audit trail for all memory operations
- âœ… GDPR compliance verified through testing

## Memory Architecture Overview

### Memory Types & Lifecycle
| Layer | TTL / Size | Content | Purpose | Storage |
|-------|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Ephemeral Buffer** | â‰¤ 30 messages or 3k tokens | Full user/assistant turns | Immediate reasoning | Redis (hash per session) |
| **Short-Term Summary** | Session lifetime | Rolling abstractive summary + key contract state | Context continuity with low tokens | Redis + Postgres JSONB |
| **Long-Term Semantic Memory** | âˆž (user-opt-in) | Facts, preferences, biographies, finished contracts | Personalization & cross-session recall | **Milvus Vector DB** |
| **Auditable Artifacts** | âˆž | Complete raw chat, FSM logs, contract JSON | Compliance / debugging | S3 / object storage |

### Trigger Rules
- **Buffer Overflow**: When buffer tokens > 3k, feed oldest 10 turns to summarizer â†’ append to Short-Term Summary, then drop from buffer
- **Memory Extraction**: Extract semantic facts/preferences from summaries â†’ store in Milvus with embeddings
- **Cleanup**: Sessions inactive >24h â†’ flush buffer â†’ permanent summary â†’ clear Redis cache

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Milvus Integration Complexity**: Start with simple vector operations, expand gradually
- **Performance Impact**: Implement caching and async processing for memory operations
- **Data Migration**: Plan careful migration from current session storage to new architecture

### Business Risks
- **Privacy Compliance**: Implement privacy-by-design from Phase 1
- **User Experience**: Ensure memory features enhance rather than slow down interactions
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
