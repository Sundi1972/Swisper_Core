```

### 🏗️ Architecture Documentation

**Created comprehensive deep-dive documentation:**

1. **Overall Architecture** (`docs/architecture/overview.md`):
   - System architecture with FSM control plane and Haystack data plane separation
   - Component interaction diagrams and data flow
   - Integration patterns and design principles

2. **Tools and Contract Management** (`docs/architecture/tools-and-contracts.md`):
   - FSM state machine contract execution flow
   - Haystack pipeline architecture for product search and preference matching
   - Tool adapter integrations (Google Shopping, checkout tools)

3. **Session and Context Management** (`docs/architecture/session-management.md`):
   - Session persistence architecture with PostgreSQL and Redis
   - Context serialization and state recovery mechanisms
   - Performance optimization with multi-level caching

4. **Memory Management** (`docs/architecture/memory-management.md`):
   - Four-tier memory system: Ephemeral Buffer, Short-Term Summary, Long-Term Semantic Memory, Auditable Artifacts
   - T5-based summarization and vector database integration
   - PII extraction and privacy handling for Switzerland compliance

### 🚀 Deployment Documentation

**Created production-ready deployment guides:**

1. **Production Strategy** (`docs/deployment/production-strategy.md`):
   - Switzerland data sovereignty compliance requirements
   - Local AI model processing architecture (T5, sentence-transformers)
   - Infrastructure scaling and monitoring strategies

2. **Local Setup Guide** (`docs/deployment/local-setup.md`):
   - Complete step-by-step development environment setup
   - Database configuration (PostgreSQL, Redis, Milvus)
   - Troubleshooting and performance optimization

3. **Frontend Template Guide** (`docs/deployment/frontend-template-guide.md`):
   - Assessment of React + TypeScript + Vite template
   - Reusability recommendations and configuration fixes
   - Integration patterns with Swisper Core backend

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

**Established comprehensive testing framework:**

1. **Testing Strategy** (`docs/testing/strategy.md`):
   - Test pyramid approach: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e
   - Component isolation testing patterns
   - Playwright configuration for browser testing
   - Performance and security testing guidelines

2. **Test Scenarios** (`docs/testing/scenarios.md`):
   - Detailed end-to-end user journey scenarios
   - Error handling and edge case testing
   - Performance benchmarking scenarios
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing

### 🎨 Frontend Template Assessment

**Evaluated and improved frontend template:**

- **Renamed**: `heiko_s_application/` → `frontend-template/` for clarity
- **Fixed**: TypeScript build configuration (removed `--noCheck` flag)
- **Assessed**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS stack
- **Recommendation**: Keep as reusable template with documented improvements needed

### 📖 README Modernization

**Completely rewrote README.md with modern standards:**

- Enhanced project description emphasizing Switzerland compliance
- Clear architecture overview with ASCII diagrams
- Comprehensive quick start and installation instructions
- Updated documentation links pointing to new structure
- Performance benchmarks and security features
- Contributing guidelines and support information

### 📋 Implementation History Organization

**Moved implementation files to organized subfolder:**

- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STEPS.md` → `docs/implementation-plans/fsm-pipeline-refactoring.md`
- `docs/STRATEGIC_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → `docs/implementation-plans/memory-architecture-plan.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` → `docs/implementation-plans/refactoring-checklist.md`
- All phase-specific guides moved with descriptive naming

## Testing Verification

### ✅ Test Naming Compliance
- **Verified**: All 43 test files follow `test_*.py` naming convention
- **Collected**: 312 tests successfully discovered by pytest
- **Organized**: Tests properly structured in `tests/` directory

### 🔍 Code Quality
- **Linting**: Ran pylint on all core modules (contract_engine, gateway, haystack_pipeline, orchestrator, tool_adapter)
- **Frontend**: TypeScript configuration improved and linting verified

## Key Benefits

### 🎯 Improved Developer Experience
- **Clear Navigation**: Logical documentation structure for easy discovery
- **Comprehensive Guides**: Step-by-step setup and deployment instructions
- **Testing Standards**: Consistent testing approach across the project
